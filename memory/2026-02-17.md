## 2026-02-17 13:28 ET — Durable memory flush
- Built and stabilized multi-agent Signal architecture around a shared dispatcher to avoid signal-cli receive lock contention.
- Added shared infra in main workspace:
  - `shared/signal_dispatcher.py`
  - `shared/signal_main_router.py`
  - `shared/SIGNAL_DISPATCH_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- DailyVerse updates:
  - Outbound Signal delivery now via `openclaw message send`.
  - Inbound reply path supports OpenClaw/session routing (`--handle-reply`) and dispatcher consumption (`--consume-dispatch`).
- SigPro updates:
  - Disabled failing OpenClaw cron implementation job.
  - Moved execution to system cron with `flock` lock.
  - Added/used dispatcher-driven code ingestion; strict auth code format is exactly `####`.
  - Tightened filtering to self note-to-self scope and sender-missing fallback only when pending+####.
  - Important commits in `VersesVersus/sigpro`: `444e290`, `1c3033c`, `9295d80`, `f1762d7`, `f2546f8`.
- NotionMotion bootstrapping is live:
  - New agent `notionmotion` created with scanner `scripts/notionmotion_bootstrap.py`.
  - Baseline seeded existing shared Notion pages as known/ignored.
  - Cron scanner runs every 10 minutes.
  - First live E2E bootstrap succeeded from shared Notion page:
    - Created agent `gyat`, workspace `/home/james/.openclaw/workspace-gyat`, private repo `https://github.com/VersesVersus/gyat`, and daily summary cron.
- GYAT project updates:
  - Added Theologist role and interlinear/thematic cross-reference research spike docs.
  - Scheduled Gemini-only throttled 3-phase research jobs to reduce burst throttling:
    - `131b9805-44f2-4d61-8eba-3b48e56ba5b2`
    - `f2a6bf98-86ef-460d-a7e1-9731622136d9`
    - `ec4c2206-0517-4671-a64d-9593599a403f`
- Repo/tag status at this point:
  - Pushed updates across workspace/dailyverse/eleventy/sigpro and created release tags `v0.0.1` where possible.
  - For shared remote collision, used `dailyverse-v0.0.1`.

## 2026-02-17 13:58 ET — Durable memory flush (Gemini pacing)
- User confirmed Gemini throttle constraint: target under 5 requests/minute.
- Implemented paced Gemini strategy for GYAT Theologist work as 3 separated one-shot cron phases:
  - phase1 job `131b9805-44f2-4d61-8eba-3b48e56ba5b2`
  - phase2 job `f2a6bf98-86ef-460d-a7e1-9731622136d9`
  - phase3 job `ec4c2206-0517-4671-a64d-9593599a403f`
- Earlier single-pass Gemini Theologist job failed with quota 429; switched to staggered low-tool-call phases.
- On user request to pause Gemini for 15 minutes, rescheduled pending phase3 job to `2026-02-17T18:51:55Z`.
